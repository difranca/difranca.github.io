# S3 (Simple Storage Service)

<br/>

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

_Amazon S3 is an object storage service offering scalability, data availability, security, and performance._

## Objects

- An object consists of:
  - _Key_: name of the object
  - _Value_: object content as a sequence of bytes
  - _Version ID_: versioning identification
  - _Metada_: name-value pairs to store information regarding the object
  - _Subresources_: store object additional information (e.g. ACL, CORS, Torrent)
- Objects can range in size from 0 B to 5 TB

:::

<br/>

## Buckets

- Container for objects stored in Amazon S3
- Bucket names must be unique across all AWS accounts in all the AWS Regions within a partition (i.e. Standard Regions, China Regions, GovCloud US)

:::

<br/>

## Consistency

- Strong read-after-write consistency for PUT and DELETE requests of object
- Updates to a single key are atomic
- S3 does not support object locking for concurrent writers (if two PUT requests are simultaneously made to the same key, the request with the latest timestamp wins)

## Storage Classes

### Frequently Accessed

- **S3 Standard**
  - Default storage class
  - Designed for frequently accessed data (more than once a month)
  - For performance-sensitive use cases (millisecond access)

### Automatically Optimized

- **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**
  - Automatically moves data to the most cost-effective access tier (Frequent Access, Infrequent Access and Archive Instant Access)
  - Useful for data that has unknown or changing access patterns
  - No retrieval fees

### Infrequently Accessed

- Designed for long-lived, infrequently accessed data (once a month)
- Millisecond access

<div/>

- **S3 Standard-IA**
  - Useful for primary or only copy of data that can't be re-created
- **S3 One Zone-IA**
  - S3 stores data in only one Availability Zone
  - Less expensive than S3 Standard-IA
  - Useful if the data can be re-created and for object replicas when setting S3 Cross-Region Replication

### Archiving

- Low-cost data archiving

<div/>

- **S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval**
  - Milliseconds retrieval
  - Less expensive than S3 Standard-IA, with the same latency and throughput performance as the S3 Standard-IA storage class
  - Higher data access costs than S3 Standard-IA
- **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieva**
  - Minutes retrieval for portions of data
  - Hours for bulk retrieval
- **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**
  - 12 hours retrieval for portions of data
  - 48 Hours for bulk retrieval
  - Lowest cost storage option in AWS

## Versioning

- Stores all versions of an object
- Once enabled it cannot be disabled, only suspended

:::note More Information

- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html

:::

<br/>

## Lifecycle Management

- Manage objects based on a set of rules
  - Transition actions: define when objects transition to another storage class
  - Expiration actions: define when objects expire.
- Can be used in conjunction with versioning for both current and non-current versions

:::note More Information

- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html

:::

<br/>

## MFA Delete

- Enforce delete operations to require MFA
- Versioning must be enabled
- Only the bucket owner (root account) can enable MFA delete

:::note More Information

- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete.html

:::

<br/>

## Cross-Region Replication

- Versioning must be enabled on both source and destination buckets
- Regions must be unique
- File in an existing bucket are not replicated automatically, but all subsequent updated files are

<br/>

## Security

### Access Control

- Bucket access can be controlled via:
  - Bucket Policies
  - Access Control Lists (ACL)
- By default, all newly created buckets are private
- S3 buckets can create access logs which logs all requests to the bucket
- Access logs can be sent to another bucket
- Presigned URLs allow users to temporarily download/upload objects to buckets without AWS security credentials or permissions

### Encryption

- Transit
  - SSL/TLS
- Rest
  - Server Side Encryption (SSE)
    - Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3)
    - KMS keys Stored in AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS)
    - Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C)
  - Client Side Encryption
